ZSH config
==========

macOS 10.15 Catalina makes `zsh` the default shell; figured I'd embrace it early.

Using Prezto and powerlevel10k

-	https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto - ZSH package set
-	powerlevel10k (faster powerlevel9k (like powerline on BASH))

	-	https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k
	-	purepower, as adapted from https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#configuration
