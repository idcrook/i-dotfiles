Some utilities that can be installed from source
================================================

```shell
go get -u github.com/jingweno/ccat
go get -d -v github.com/moorereason/mdfmt
cd ~/go/src/github.com/moorereason/mdfmt
go get github.com/gohugoio/hugo@v0.49.2
go get -v github.com/moorereason/mdfmt
```

### markdownfmt -> mdfmt

Switched from `markdownfmt` since it does not handle front matter in the markdown files

```shell
go get -u github.com/shurcooL/markdownfmt
```
