# USAGE:
# 1. Replace `{ insert repo url here }` at the bottom with your GH repo's URL
# 2. `chmod +x open-xcode-selection-in-gh.sh` to make it executable
# 3. Create a new Behaviour in Xcode settings. In the bottom, select "Run script", and choose this file
# 4. Next to your new behaviour in the list, click the cmd symbol to add to keyboard shortcut

# Use AppleScript to get the open file and selection from Xcode
